# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-model-for-CKD-predicton
This project is focused on using the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset, which is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains medical attributes related to kidney disease, and the goal is to build a MLP(Artificial Neural Network)model to predict whether a patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) or not.
